    <h1>The 5 Types of Clients I’ve Met (And Which One Are You?)</h1>

  <main>
    <p>Let’s face it—clients come in all shapes, sizes, and personalities. As a [insert your service, e.g., website designer, writer, consultant], I’ve had my fair share of clients, each with their own <em>unique</em> traits. Whether you're a newbie or a seasoned pro, you’ve probably met (or <em>are</em>) one of these clients. Let’s dive in!</p>

    <h2>1. The "I Know Exactly What I Want...But Not Really" Client</h2>
    <p><strong>This client comes in with a vision—bright, shiny, and clear as day. The only problem? The vision is actually a vague Pinterest board of 87 different ideas, none of which go together.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Common Symptoms:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Emails full of phrases like, “I’m thinking something sleek but bold...and maybe a little vintage, but not too vintage.”</li>
      <li>Constant redesign requests after the first draft (because they’ve now seen 15 other “inspirations”).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How to Handle:</strong></p>
    <p>Patiently guide them through the process. Remind them that “sleek but bold” is <em>not</em> a design concept, but with a lot of empathy and your expert advice, you can find their true vision. Or at least try. <em>Fingers crossed.</em></p>

    <h2>2. The "Ghost" Client</h2>
    <p><strong>This client is a magician—they’re there one minute, then poof! Vanished into thin air.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Common Symptoms:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Responding to emails with enthusiasm, scheduling calls, and then...nothing.</li>
      <li>They disappear for weeks and resurface with, “Oh, sorry! I just had a lot going on.”</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How to Handle:</strong></p>
    <p>Set clear deadlines and follow up like a pro. Make sure they know when you need a response, and if that doesn’t work, try sending them a virtual carrier pigeon (it’s 2025, so that should work, right?).</p>

    <h2>3. The "Budget Wizard" Client</h2>
    <p><strong>Ah, the budget wizard. They’ve managed to find every available discount, but still expect you to pull magic out of a hat.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Common Symptoms:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>“I’m working with a really tight budget. Can you make the website <em>cheaper</em>...and maybe throw in extra revisions for free?”</li>
      <li>They’ll ask for “just a small adjustment” that <em>might</em> involve a complete redesign.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How to Handle:</strong></p>
    <p>Be clear about your rates and scope of work. It’s okay to say no when the demands go beyond what’s reasonable. And remember, just because they have a budget doesn’t mean your expertise is worth any less!</p>

    <h2>4. The "Perfectionist" Client</h2>
    <p><strong>This client sees every tiny detail. And I mean <em>every</em> tiny detail. Did you use the exact shade of blue they mentioned in an email? Was the font choice “too modern”?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Common Symptoms:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Requesting changes that nobody would notice, not even their grandma.</li>
      <li>Expecting the moon and stars (and the best-of-the-best) on a shoestring budget.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How to Handle:</strong></p>
    <p>You’ll need an infinite supply of patience here. Educate them on the importance of “done is better than perfect.” Trust that you’ve got the skills to make it great without losing your mind. And hey, it might even make them happy!</p>

    <h2>5. The "I’m Too Cool for Details" Client</h2>
    <p><strong>This client walks in, says, “Just make it look good,” and expects you to read their mind. They <em>don’t</em> want to be bothered with the little details.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Common Symptoms:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Emails that read, “I trust you. Just do your thing.”</li>
      <li>Showing zero interest in the process, feedback, or collaborating.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How to Handle:</strong></p>
    <p>While it may sound like a dream (less work for you, right?), don’t let them get away without input. It’s time to make sure they <em>do</em> give feedback, even if you have to send a friendly reminder every once in a while.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you’ve got a business, you need a website. Not next year. Not “when things pick up.” Now.
    </blockquote>

    <p>If you're not sure where to start, let me help you. It's what I do—and I love watching businesses glow up online.</p>
