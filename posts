Having a website is like owning a 24/7 storefront in the digital world. Without one, your business risks being invisible to customers who search online.  

In this post, I’ll break down why every business—no matter the size—absolutely needs a website:  

1. **Credibility:** A website shows you’re serious and professional.  
2. **Reach:** Customers can find you anytime, anywhere.  
3. **Control:** You control your brand’s story and message.  
4. **Sales:** A website can be your best salesperson, day or night.  

Don’t sleep on it. Building a website today is easier than ever, and it’s the smartest move you’ll make for your business growth.
