    <h1>Why Every Business Needs a Website</h1>

    <p>Let’s be real—if your business isn’t online in 2025, you’re basically invisible. I said what I said.</p>

    <h2>1. It’s Your 24/7 Storefront</h2>
    <p>Your website works while you sleep. It welcomes customers, shows them what you offer, answers questions, and says, “Hey, we’re legit.” All day. All night.</p>

    <h2>2. Builds Trust & Credibility</h2>
    <p>People Google *everything* before they buy. No website? That’s a red flag. A sleek, simple site tells people, “We know our stuff. You’re in good hands.”</p>

    <h2>3. You Control the Narrative</h2>
    <p>Social media is nice, but your website? That’s your kingdom. You decide what people see, read, feel. You tell your story, your way.</p>

    <h2>4. Boosts Visibility</h2>
    <p>With SEO (search engine optimization), your site can pop up when someone searches for “thrift stores in Nairobi” or “affordable web design.” Free marketing, baby.</p>

    <h2>5. Converts Curious Clicks into Customers</h2>
    <p>Want bookings? Orders? DMs that actually lead to sales? A well-designed website guides visitors like, “Hey, click here to buy.” Simple. Smart. Smooth.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you’ve got a business, you need a website. Not next year. Not “when things pick up.” Now.
    </blockquote>

    <p>If you're not sure where to start, let me help you. It's what I do—and I love watching businesses glow up online.</p>
